# IEEE 1516-2010 Interface Specification Java API

This is a "clone" of the standard IEEE 1516-2010.1 Java API source files. These
source files can be downloaded from
[the IEEE](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1516_1-2010.html). The source
files contain the following licence:

> The IEEE hereby grants a general, royalty-free license to copy, distribute,

Note that this Java API is a mix of interfaces and implemented classes. They are
sufficient to develop against, but an RTI that provides an implementation of the
interfaces is required to test actual functionality.
